[00:02.21]Daniel Mendoza
[00:09.93]How many unsuccessful attempts did Mendoza make before becoming Champion of all England?
[00:18.59]Boxing matches were very popular in England two hundred years ago.
[00:23.52]In those days, boxers fought with bare fists for prize money.
[00:28.93]Because of this, they were known as 'prizefighters'.
[00:33.27]However, boxing was very crude,
[00:36.63]for there were no rules and a prizefighter could be seriously injured or even killed during a match.
[00:44.94]One of the most colourful figures in boxing history was Daniel Mendoza, who was born in 1764.
[00:53.56]The use of gloves was not introduced until 1860, when the Marquis of Queensberry drew up the first set of rules.
[01:02.63]Though he was technically a prizefighter,
[01:05.75]Mendoza did much to change crude prizefighting into a sport, for he brought science to the game.
[01:13.71]In his day, Mendoza enjoyed tremendous popularity.
[01:18.41]He was adored by rich and poor alike.
[01:21.94]Mendoza rose to fame swiftly after a boxing match when he was only fourteen years old.
[01:28.42]This attracted the attention of Richard Humphries who was then the most eminent boxer in England.
[01:35.87]He offered to train Mendoza and his young pupil was quick to learn.
[01:40.98]In fact, Mendoza soon became so successful that Humphries turned against him.
[01:48.01]The two men quarrelled bitterly and it was clear that the argument could only be settled by a fight.
[01:56.50]A match was held at Stilton, where both men fought for an hour.
[02:01.60]The public bet a great deal of money on Mendoza, but he was defeated.
[02:07.22]Mendoza met Humphries in the ring on a later occasion and he lost for a second time.
[02:13.97]It was not until his third match in 1790 that he finally beat Humphries and became Champion of England.
[02:23.50]Meanwhile, he founded a highly successful Academy and even Lord Byron became one of his pupils.
[02:31.59]He earned enormous sums of money and was paid as much as ï¿¡100 for a single appearance.
[02:39.85]Despite this, he was so extravagant that he was always in debt.
[02:45.91]After he was defeated by a boxer called Gentleman Jackson, he was quickly forgotten.
[02:52.53]He was sent to prison for failing to pay his debts and died in poverty in 1836.
