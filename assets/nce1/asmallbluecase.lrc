[00:07.03]Listen to the tape then answer this question.
[00:12.79]Does Mr. Hall get his case back?

[00:24.39]Can you describe it, sir?
[00:27.81]It's a small blue case and it's got a zip.
[00:34.27]There's a label on the handle with my name and address on it.
[00:40.41]Is this case yours?
[00:43.14]No, that's not mine.
[00:45.83]What about this one?
