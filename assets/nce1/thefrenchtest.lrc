[00:00.66]Lesson 103
[00:03.54]The French test
[00:06.77]Listen to the tape then answer this question.
[00:12.82]How long did the exam last?
[00:17.91]How was the exam, Richard?
[00:20.80]Not too bad.
[00:22.56]I think I passed in English and Mathematics.
[00:27.28]The questions were very easy.
[00:30.34]How about you, Gary?
[00:33.99]The English and Maths papers weren't easy enough for me.
[00:39.98]I hope I haven't failed.
[00:42.79]I think I failed the French paper.
[00:46.60]I could answer sixteen of the questions.
[00:50.56]They were very easy.
[00:53.03]But I couldn't answer the rest.
[00:56.21]They were too difficult for me.
[01:00.29]French tests are awful, aren't they?
[01:03.85]I hate them.
[01:05.72]I'm sure I've got a low mark.
[01:10.13]Oh, cheer up!
[01:12.73]Perhaps we didn't do too badly.
[01:17.01]The guy next to me wrote his name at the top of the paper.
[01:22.53]Yes?
[01:24.11]Then he sat there and looked at it for three hours!
[01:29.36]He didn't write a word!
