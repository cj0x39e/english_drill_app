## About the logo

The app's logo was almost designed by my oldest son (a seven-year-old boy). It looks like a dinosaur or a lizard. It's actually a turtle from Pokemon named Squirtle. Hope you like it.

## License

MIT, but don't use it to make money, like sell it on XIANYU or TAOBAO or PINDUODUO, etc.
